##About [Wikitongues](http://www.wikitongues.org)

Wikitongues is an international non-profit organization founded to develop and maintain public access to all of the world’s 7,000 languages. 

In coordination with a network of volunteers in over twenty countries and a growing community of online subscribers, we work to obtain video recordings of speakers and signers worldwide as well as other types of linguistic and cultural documentation, such as bilingual phrasebooks and oral histories. 

Formed as an outlet for free expression in one’s native language, Wikitongues is intended to further language education and cultural fluency, and to combat linguistic prejudice and discrimination.

We publish videos weekly on our [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/wikitongues/videos) channel.
